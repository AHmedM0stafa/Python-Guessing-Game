# Guessing Game Challenge

The Challenge:

To Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:

1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"

2. On all turns, if a guess is 
 * closer to the number than the previous guess return "Closer!"
 * farther from the number than the previous guess, return "Farther!"
3. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!
